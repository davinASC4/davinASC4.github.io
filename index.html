            <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>My name is Andy Mina and if you couldn't tell from the landing page, I'm an aspiring dreamer.
                I am senior at Brooklyn Tech High School. I major in Media Communications and Graphic Design. 
                Through my major, I am Adobe Photoshop CS6 certified as well as Adobe Illustrator CS6 certified. 
                I love to explore the arts, so I play (and also teach!) in my school's orchestra. 
                I am a strong believer of having a growth mindset, which in short, means nothing is ever done 
                and there will always be room for improvement. A prime example of my growth mindset at work is this
                 website. If you check in on this website in a month or so, I might change some things, add more stuff, 
                 or make a new design. I made and designed this website, and if you want, I can make one like this for 
                 you, too! I learned how to code during my sophomore summer at All Star Code. All Star Code is an all
                  boys six-week summer intensive dedicated to promoting diversity in the ever-growing tech industry. 
                  Not only that, but this program also teaches its students about developing a growth mindset 
                  alongside professionalism and soft skills. This program changed my life. I felt I had to give back to 
                  a program so monumental, so I applied to be a Teaching Fellow. Now, I teach students whose shoes
                   I was just in last year. My goal is to be a software engineer at a top level company and give back 
                   to my communities. I have a long way to go before I get there, but I'm ready to embark on this
                    journey. If you want to hear more about my professional side which includes, graphic design, software
                     engineering, website development, and teaching, you can check out my résumé or my LinkedIn profile. 
                     If you still have further questions, you can always shoot me an email at andymina.business@gmail.com.
